## Privacy enhanced Verifiable Credentials (VC) Hub

A platform where Verifiable Credential Issuers can create new types of credentials or reuse existing standards and issue them to owners with ease. Owners selectively disclose some or all the data in their Verifiable Credential with Verifiers via Zero Knowledge proofs while Verifiers obtain only the information needed.
